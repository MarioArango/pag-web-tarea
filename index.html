                    <li><strong>2014</strong> - Opening of Bowling on the Beach</li>

                <br/>
                <p class="cursiva-underline">Today - Bowling in the Deep is working to expand to California and other cities</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In 2020, Rob Martini, owner and founder of the newly built Bowling in the Deep, wanted to expand his passion for bowling and love of the ocean into an all inclusive bowling alley. Rob already had a bowling alley directly on Miami Beach, named Bowling on the Beach which was built in 2014, but after 7 years Rob wanted to not only renovate, but design a completely new bowling alley where the building is encapsulated around the actual ocean.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Being already located centrally on Miami Beach, Rob was able to capture the atmosphere of actually being in the ocean by creating an expansive aquarium surrounding 40 new synthetic bowling lanes, making this also the biggest bowling alley in all of Florida as well! Our new scoring system and pinsetters makes it perfect for bowlers of any skill level to have fun.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>While bowling you can see a variety of oceanic wildlife including stingrays, sharks, and even dolphins. Across the bowling alley is our new bar and grill, which offers plenty of seafood options on the menu and comes fresh from the ocean daily. On the bar are plenty of TV’s where you can watch the latest sports games and downstairs features an extensive arcade for all age groups including air hockey and pool tables. This has quickly become Miami’s newest and biggest tourist attraction yet and we are hoping to expand to California as well as other cities soon! So if you’re planning on visiting Miami or Miami Beach, please feel free to stop by to bowl or to just see some oceanic wildlife. Doors are free to enter!</p>
